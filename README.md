# Rhombus
This application draws on the screen a rhombus for which the size of one of the diagonals has been entered from the user's keyboard.
## Compile and run
The application can be found in the file 'code 102.cpp' and is written in the C++ language. Consequently, an IDE that supports applications written in C++ (for example Codeblocks) will be used for compilation and running.
## Input data
The user enters from the keyboard the size of one of the diagonals of the rhombus n, which must be a natural number greater than 1.
## Output data
This application will draw a rhombus on the screen, for which the size of one of the diagonals is:
- n, if n is odd;
- n + 1, if n is even.
